{"instance": {"reviewtext": "Love this product. Our dog suffers from anxiety and he has been so much better since we put him on this diet. He is always excited to eat each night; I recommend it to anyone who will listen, especially if their dog has strange issues such as anxiety or hyperactivity - my parents' dog had symptoms of depression and changing to this diet helped him too - he was never food driven and now he LOVES his food. Top product, our dog is very very healthy on this diet."}, "prediction": {"confidences": [0.9864986538887024, 0.013501346111297607], "displayNames": ["1", "0"]}}
